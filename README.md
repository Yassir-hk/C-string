# CString

This repository contains a collection of string manipulation functions implemented in C. These functions provide various operations on strings, such as copying, concatenating, comparing, searching, and more. They are designed to mimic some of the standard string functions available in the "string.h" C library.

## Implemented functions

This table represent the implemented functions and their description

| Function    | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `max2`      | Return the maximum value between two values                                                      |
| `strlen2`   | Return the length of a string                                                                    |
| `strcpy2`   | Copy source string to destination string and return the new string                                |
| `strncpy2`  | Copy n characters from source string to destination string and return the new string             |
| `strcat2`   | Concatenate source string with destination string and return the new string                       |
| `strncat`   | Concatenate n characters from source string with destination string and return the new string    |
| `strcmp2`   | Compare two strings and return a negative value if str1 < str2, 0 if str1 == str2, positive value otherwise |
| `strncmp2`  | Compare the first n characters of two strings                                                    |
| `strchr2`   | Search for the first occurrence of a character in a string and return a pointer to that character |
| `strstr2`   | Search for the first occurrence of str2 in str1 and return a pointer to that string, otherwise NULL |
| `strcspn2`  | Return the length of the longest sub-string of str1 that does not contain any characters from str2 |
| `strrev2`   | Reverse a string                                                                                 |
| `strlwr2`   | Convert lowercase characters of a string to uppercase characters                                |
| `strupr2`   | Convert uppercase characters of a string to lowercase characters                                |
